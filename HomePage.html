			<h2 class="classForH2FirstParagraphMain">Hello</h2>
			<div class="classFirstParagraphMainPagePortfolio">This is my first and simple portfolio. 
				My name is Maxim Bekker, I am 17 years old at the time of writing this site, the first serious programming language was C#, which could help me fall in love with programming.
			</div>

				<h2 class="classForH2SecondParagraphMain">My Hard-skills</h2>
				<div id="secondParagraphMain">
					<div id="second1ParagraphMainPagePortfolio">
						<h2>C#</h2>
						<a href="https://github.com/Cocombear">
							I fell in love with C# thanks to SimpleCode lessons and Roman Sakutin's instructions. In basic C#, I have coded everything that is possible, from simple calculators to text games.
						</a>
					</div>
					<div id="second2ParagraphMainPagePortfolio">
						<h2>WPF</h2>
						<a href="file:///C:/Users/%D0%A1%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B3%D0%B5%D0%B9/Desktop/Html/%D0%9D%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%8F%20%D0%BF%D0%B0%D0%BF%D0%BA%D0%B0/ProjectPage.html">
							I learned this development technology first due to the presence of additional lessons in the course. At the moment there is a ready-made application for working with the database.
						</a>
					</div>
					<div id="second3ParagraphMainPagePortfolio">
						<h2>ASP.Net core</h2>
						<a href="file:///C:/Users/%D0%A1%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B3%D0%B5%D0%B9/Desktop/Html/%D0%9D%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%8F%20%D0%BF%D0%B0%D0%BF%D0%BA%D0%B0/ProjectPage.html">
							Learning this technology happened thanks to a friend who said "Let's go create microservices" and I'm like "Why?" so in Ozon there are many internships for this direction.
						</a>
					</div>
					<div id="second4ParagraphMainPagePortfolio">
						<h2>HTML5 and CSS3</h2>
						<a>
							I started learning layout for ASP.Net core to make beautiful website designs. What is the result? This site is my first serious project on HTML and CSS, for a long time I could not decide what to do, and then I looked at the idea from a friend.
						</a>
					</div>
					<div id="second5ParagraphMainPagePortfolio">
						<h2>PostgreSQL</h2>
						<a>
							Why not MySql or MS Sql? The first reason is the Ozon company, the main DBMS was just PostgreSql. The second reason PostgreSql is free.
							The third reason I have a pirated Windows, because of which MS Sql does not work.\
