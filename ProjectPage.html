				<h2 id="h2ForProjectWPFDesctop">Database application</h2>
				<p id="firstParagraphProjectWPF">
					This is my first serious project using WPF technology and XAML. The project turned out to be simple, but thanks to it, I got such experience as developing a design and ideas, thinking through the project structure and properly structuring the code.
				</p>
				<p id="imageProjectWorkDBAdminInterfaceScreenshot"></p>
				<p id="secondParagraphProjectWPF">
					The idea of the application is very simple: An employee can enter the application and see his 	active task, characteristics, position, full name and salary, and in the application you can add Administrators who have access to the administrator interface, which allows you to edit the profiles of ordinary employees. I believe that the application has the right to life, but subject to further processing.

				<h2 id="h2ForProjectAspNetCore">Area calculation</h2>
				<p id="firstParagraphProjectAspNetCore">
					I don't consider this a project as it was a test task from MindBox. According to the assignment, it was necessary to make a website on which you can calculate the area of figures, one of the additional tasks was to calculate the area while not knowing the type of figure, it was from this condition that the site was developed. The design is missing due to the lack of the necessary knowledge at that time. I think that everything was done very crookedly, but at the same time, the development gave a strong leap in development and understanding of what needs to be learned further, which subsequently led to the creation of this site.

				<h2 id="h2forPrjectBTO">Online ticketing application</h2>
				<p id="firstParagraphProjectBto">
					Well, it seems not bad, buying a ticket online has comparable settings than quickly becoming at the box office, and as a basis I wanted to take tickets for commuter trains in the Russian Federation, but in the end I couldn’t finish the project, I realized that I didn’t have enough skills to create a normal design and any social projects are difficult to do alone, but one of the main tasks was the implementation of clean code, an example of which was taken from the book "Clean Code" by Robert Martin and the creation of one natural and readable application structure.
